                <p>
                    When you commission me, or any artist for that matter, it is very important to understand that we all have different styles and artistic expertise.
                    Take some time to review some of my other work, and learn a bit about my style. As an artist, I am constantly experimenting with my skills and artwork. If you see a
                    specific style you liked of my work and would like something similar, please let me know!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please be aware of my policies and <a href="./tos.html">Terms of Service</a>. There are a lot of things you should be aware when it comes to
                    using your commissioned artwork such as how payments and refunds work, and what content I will and won't draw. I do my best to answer and cover all questions,
                    but if you have more, please message me.

                <p>
                    Plan ahead of time if you’re going to order from an artist. Maybe keep a notebook of ideas you’d like to see from various artists. Things
                    like which characters you would like to see drawn in a specific artist's style. This is very helpful when you see flash sales or quick slots, as you'll be able to jump right on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You don’t always need the full details! I am more than willing to help you out best that I can with brainstorming your order if you need it. The most important part is
                    haveing a good idea on what you want for subject matter. This is what matters the most in the completion of the project, and functions as a solid jumping-off point most of the time.
                    And be sure to let me know what kind of order you’re looking to get: sketches, line art, full artwork, or even just some icons.

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                <p>
                    Well, unless you ask me to. I bet that would make for a fun picture. This is where it starts to get fun, all you have to do now is reach out to me.
                    Just tell me your name, contact information, references, and a rough description of the commission you have in mind and we can discuss further,
                    and I can start coming up with a price estimate for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you ever need help brainstorming a character development or commission idea, I do keep a work-only skype ready for instant messenger use. I can chat with you
                    real time and help you come up with your next brilliant picture! I love working with the customers and helping with creative flow. If you don’t need any help
                    and know exactly what you want, that’s no problem at all! Gets to the drawing part much more quickly.

            <a class="accordion-title"><h3>Step 4: Sending payment.</h3></a>
            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                <p>
                    As I’ve mentioned in my <a href="./tos.html">Terms of Service</a>, I will not draw until I receive payment. If the commission order is $30 USD or below,
                    I require payment up-front in full. If the commission turns out to be larger and more costly, I require a $30 USD down payment to begin.
                    Once I have finished the order and shown you a watermarked version for your approval, you will send me the rest of the payment.
                    Once I have received it I will send you the unmarked version of your commission. Please read the TOS for full details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do prefer all payments be sent through Paypal. I will also accept cash payments at conventions or in person. The longer you wait to send payment,
                    the longer it will take to get started on your commission.
                </p>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                <p>
                    This is where I get to have some fun. If you purchased a small order like a chibi or icon from me, I will take your references and
                    complete the artwork to get back to you as soon as possible. If you do end up purchasing something a bit larger I will be happy to show a sketch
                    upon request for approval.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Edits and adjustments all should be made in the sketch stages. Minor alterations can be made in the line art. Once I begin coloring
                    no more edits can be made to the base of the picture. I do expect you to give me some artistic liberties with each project, and I will do my
                    best to make sure it fits the description you have on your order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I use all artwork as portfolio references and do post them online for others to see. If you would like to keep your order private there will be an extra fee.

                <p>
                    If you purchased a physical art product such as prints, posters, or button set, I will package each individual order with care as needed.
                    I ship things out Monday – Friday. All packages will be insured for the full cost of the commission order. If you would like to skip insurance fees
                    please contact us to let us know, but please be warned that it is then no longer our responsibility should the package get lost or damaged.

    <h2>Clover Coin Commission Price Guide</h2>
    <p>
        Hey everyone, this is just a quick reference sheet for my prices for you all to go off of. These are all just rough estimates based on the
        fact that I work at $30 USD an hour. ALL PRICES DO VARY PER PROJECT! You will never know the for sure price of your commission until I see your
        order and it’s details are discussed in full. I will give you the final price on your project.
    </p>
    <p>
        I do require all a $30 USD down payment on all larger commissions before beginning. All small commission orders will not be reviewed by
        the customer as it is too time consuming. Please make sure my art style is what you’re looking for. You will allow me artist freedoms and
        liberties to experiment with your character and order if it is under $30 USD. I will do my best to keep it as close to the commissioners request as possible.
    </p>
